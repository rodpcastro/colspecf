following conditions:

1. User acknowledges that the Software is still in the development stage and
   that it is being supplied "as is," without any support services from ACM.
   Neither ACM nor the author makes any representations or warranties, express

Computer Physics Communications (CPC) User License

Disclaimer and non-profit use license agreement

The CPC non-profit use license agreement is an agreement between the author(s)
of a program distributed by the CPC Program Library and the person who acquires
it. By acquiring the program the person is agreeing to be bound by the terms of
this agreement.

1. This license entitles the licensee (one person) and the licensee's
   research group to obtain a copy of the source or executable code and to use
   the acquired program for academic or non-profit use within a research group;
   or, it entitles the licensee (one company, organization or computing center)
   to install the program and allow access to the executable code to members of
   the licensee's organization for academic or non-profit use. No user or site
   will re-distribute the source code or executable code to a third party in
   original or modified form without the written permission of the author.

2. Publications which result from using the acquired program will reference
   the article in Computer Physics Communications which describes the program.

3. This license does not permit any commercial (profit-making or proprietary)
   use or re-licensing or re-distributions. Persons interested in for-profit
   use should contact the author.

4. To the extent permissible under applicable laws, no responsibility is
